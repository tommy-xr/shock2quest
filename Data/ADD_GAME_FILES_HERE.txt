# ADD GAME FILES HERE

In order to run the game locally on desktop, you must copy over your own version of the game files.

The folder structure should look like:

```
- ..\shock2quest
    - \Data
        - \res
            - bitmap.crf
            - book.crf
            - editor.crf
            - fam.crf
            - fonts.crf
            - iface.crf
            - ...
        - command1.mis
        - shock2.gam
        - ...
```

If you do not have a copy of the game, you can find it here:
- [System Shock 2 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/238210/System_Shock_2/)
- [System Shock 2 on GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shock_2)

You can often find it sale, but it is well worth the price.
